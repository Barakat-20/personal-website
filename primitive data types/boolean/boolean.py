#  EXERCISE 3 - HOW MUCH WOOD WOULD A WOODCHUCK CHUCK?
#
#  Two children were asked to guess how many times the characters "wood"
#  and "chuck" (but NOT in the word "woodchuck") appeared in the famous
#  'tongueTwiser'. You have two tasks:
#  - Get the correct number of times "wood" and "chuck" appeared in 'tongueTwiser',
#    not including in "woodchuck", and save them into 'numberOfWood' and 'numberOfChuck' respectively
#  - Confirm they BOTH GOT AT LEAST ONE GUESS CORRECT for either
#    occurence of "wood" or "chuck" and save it into 'bothAtLeastOneCorrect'
#
# tongueTwiser was concatenated like this so the string does not go out of view
tongueTwiser = "How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? "
tongueTwiser += "He would chuck, he would, as much as he could, and chuck as much wood, "
tongueTwiser += "as a woodchuck would if a woodchuck could chuck wood."

#  EXERCISE 4 - TRUTHY AND FALSY
#
#  As well as a type, each value also has an inherent boolean value,
#  generally known as either truthy or falsy. Some of the rules are a
#  little bizarre so have a look at the following conversions using
#  the bool() conversion function, which will look at the non-boolean
#  data types and return their inherent boolean value
#
falsy1 = falsy2 = falsy3 = None
truthy1 = truthy2 = None
# Uncomment the lines below to see what they evaluate to
#
###################### YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE #######################

#
#  The following code tests the variables you need to work on to confirm your work is
#  correct. The if conditions check the variables are correct and the print()
#  statements are what make the print outs you see when you run the file. The below
#  is a crude demonstration of what we refer to as code tests. Code testing is a
#  common practice in the software engineer's role, where tests are run to confirm all
#  code runs correctly. Only when all tests pass would we give ourselves the green light
#  to ship code to production and feel confident the system will perform as expected.
